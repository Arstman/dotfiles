This is my humble and ever-evolving collection of dotfiles and shell scripts.

If you're looking for quality stuff you ought to look elsewhere as I'm still a bit of a newbie.

The setup:
 - X (display server)
 - dwm (window manager)
 - dwmblocks (status bar)
 - dmenu (custom status bar menus)
 - xcompmgr (compositor)
 - alacritty (terminal emulator)
 - zsh (shell)
 - nnn (file browser)
 - nvim (text editor)
 - neomutt (e-mail client)
 - sxhkd (hotkey daemon)
 - mpd (music daemon)
 - ncmpcpp (music client)
 - mpv (video player)
 - ffpmeg (video recording and editing)
 - zathura (document viewer)
 - firefox (web browser)
 - transmission (pirate ship)
 - feh (image viewer)
 - redshift (night light)
 - slock (screen lock)
 - taskwarrior (todos and task management)
 - nvidia-xrun (better GPU utilization for gaming)

dwmblocks statusbar components:
 - Currently playing song title + playlist index
 - Volume
 - Brightness
 - CPU temp
 - GPU temp
 - memory usage
 - battery status
 - internet status
 - keyboard layout
 - time and date

dmenus:
 - keyboard layout menu: choose between ANSI us(QWERTY), ISO hu(QWERTY), and ANSI colemak mod-dh
 - color theme menu: choose which terminal color scheme to use (doesn't actually work very well)
 - playlist menu: tell mpd which playlist to play
 - youtube-dl menu: download youtube video that the clipboarded link points to. choose format and quality
 - mount menu: mount or unmount external drives, adroid devices, virtual disks
 - display menu: choose which screens to use (uses hardcoded values for my current setup)
 - shutdown menu: shutdown / reboot / suspend / turn off screens
