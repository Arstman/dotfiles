This is my humble collection of configuration files and command line scripts. 

My setup:
 - X (display server)
 - dmw (window manager)
 - dwmblocks (status bar thingy)
 - dmenu 
 - xcompmgr (compositor)
 - alacritty (terminal emulator)
 - zsh (shell)
 - nnn (file browser)
 - nvim (text editor)
 - neomutt (e-mail client)
 - sxhkd (hotkey utility)
 - mpd+ncmpcpp (music player)
 - mpv (video player)
 - ffpmeg (video recording)
 - zathura (document viewer)
 - firefox (web browser)
 - transmission (pirate ship)
 - feh (image viewer)
 - redshift (night light)
 - slock (screen lock)
 - nvidia-xrun (better GPU utilization for gaming)
 
I try to keep my setup lightweight but highly functional and as comfy as possible. 
Everything is accessible by pressing a couple keys on the keyboard; on the contrary, not everything is accessible by mouse.

My statusbar blocks:
 - Currently playing song title + playlist index
 - Volume
 - Brightness
 - CPU temp
 - GPU temp
 - memory usage
 - battery status
 - internet status
 - keyboard layout
 - time and date
 
dmenu is very cool.
My menus:
 - keyboard layout menu: choose between ANSI us(QWERTY), ISO hu(QWERTY), and ANSI colemak mod-dh
 - color theme menu: choose which terminal color scheme to use (might need to restart the terminal for all the changes to take effect :( )
 - playlist menu: tell mpd which playlist to play
 - youtube-dl menu: download youtube video that the clipboarded link points to. choose format and quality
 - mount menu: mount or unmount external drives, adroid devices, virtual disks
 - display menu: choose which screens to use (uses hardcoded values for my current setup)
 - shutdown menu: shutdown / reboot / suspend / turn off screens

Some of my scripts are inspired by (or directly taken from) Luke Smith's voidrice setup.
